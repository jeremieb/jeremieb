## Indie iOS Developer

I build thoughtful, high-quality native apps across Apple platforms.

With 20+ years of experience spanning product design and software development, I work at the intersection of **product thinking × Swift engineering** — turning ideas into shipped, maintainable, real-world applications.

My background as a Lead Product Designer gives me a systems-level perspective:

- Understand the problem  
- Design the experience  
- Architect the solution  
- Ship and iterate  

## What I Focus On

- Swift & SwiftUI  
- Native-first architecture  
- Long-term maintainability  
- Clean, scalable codebases  
- Product clarity over feature overload  

Alongside my independent apps, I collaborate with teams who value strong foundations, thoughtful execution, and alignment between design and engineering.

Recently, my work explores spatial computing and new interaction paradigms — always grounded in practical product thinking.

I believe good software is built deliberately:  
**clear architecture, respectful UX, sustainable pace.**
