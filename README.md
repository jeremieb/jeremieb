Bonjour, I am a Senior Product Designer. I design mobile apps from start to finish, for iOS and Android platforms. Not only am I competent in all aspects of the design process, but also strong at communicating design intent verbally and visually What makes me unique is a special blend of creative, technologist, iOS developer, and UI/UXer.
